I'm Kshitij Bhardwaj, a person with mixed goals to achieve and several aspirations to fulfill. I love designing and developing open-source websites and applications and give my best into it. At the same time, my love for Physics and Mathematics is something that attracts me and keep me engaged for uncountable hours. But I get through and balance out both sides, maintaining appropriate pace and enjoying satisfaction from sides. I love to learn and collaborate with people better experienced. I believe that anything is possible with enough determination and practice and try to live upto this everyday!
