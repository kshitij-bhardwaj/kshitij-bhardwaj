My academic interests converge at the intersection of computer science and physical sciences. I am particularly drawn to the application of machine learning, specifically TensorFlow, in domains such as astrophysics. My goal is to leverage these tools to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. Additionally, I have a strong foundation in graphic design, allowing me to effectively communicate technical information visually. 

I am excited about the potential synergies between mechanical engineering and machine learning. I believe that by combining these disciplines, we can develop innovative solutions to complex engineering challenges.
